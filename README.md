mruby-sfml-audio
================

mruby bindings for [SFML Audio](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Binded
* Listener
* Music
* Sound
* SoundBuffer
* SoundBufferRecorder

## Abstracted

These are classes or modules, that simply exist for reflecting the SFML API.
Classes that inherit these, will define all the methods themselves, therefore, these classes tend to be empty in ruby.

* AlResource
* SoundRecorder
* SoundSource
* SoundStream
